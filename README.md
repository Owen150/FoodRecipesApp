# FoodRecipesApp
Food Recipes App in Kotlin using MVVM Architecture.

Libraries and technologies used to build this app:
Navigation component : one activity contains multiple fragments instead of creating multiple .activites
.Retrofit : making HTTP connection with the rest API and convert meal json file to Kotlin/Java object
.Room : Save meals in local database
MVVM & LiveData : Saperate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen .configuration changes
.Coroutines : do some code in the background
.view binding : instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that
.Glide : Catch images and load them in imageView
